Saturday 
- Review the Project Outline: Go over the game concept, class structure, and basic logic. Ensure that all necessary HTML elements and CSS styles are planned out.
Set Up Project Structure: Create your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. You donâ€™t need to write much code, but get the project structure ready.
- Play with Simple CSS: Set up the basic layout of the game area using CSS (e.g., background color or a simple image for the game area).

Sunday
HTML & CSS:
- Finish setting up the main game area layout (game grid or container).
- Add placeholders for elements like the score display, lives display, and character icons (James Bond, villains).

Basic Character Class:
- Start coding the Character class in JavaScript (handle properties like x, y, speed, etc.).
- Implement the basic movement logic for the player (up, down, left, right).

Monday
Basic Game Logic:
- Set up the Game class and initialize the game loop.
- Implement the ability to add multiple villains on screen.
- Create the event listeners for moving the player with arrow keys or WASD.
